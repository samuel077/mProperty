# mProperty
A mobile project of property manager in HSNG. This code base will be installed on Android studio.

This mobile application (Android) will integrate bar code scanner zxing ( or other bar code scanner third party library ) to check every items in HSNG lab. 
This project could probably be used in CSIE CCU. 

in this project, the UE/UX would be considered. We will try to build up an ugly but smooth application. Any feedback is welcomed.
